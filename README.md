## Pre-Requisites

To get the most from this workshop, you'll need to install the following software:

* A recent version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (this project has been tested with Python 3.13.12 on macOS Tahoe 26.0.1).
* [Git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* A code editor of your choice ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good all-rounder).  Anything that you're comfortable using to browse and do minor editing on Python files is fine.
* The MicroPython [`mpremote`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) remote control utility.

Proceed once you have all of these installed.
